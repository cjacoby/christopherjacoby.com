I am a Staff Research Engineer at Antares Audio Technologies, as well as: husband, father, musician, hobbyist baker, and coffee enthusiast.

Lately, I'm curious about:

- Deep Learning on Audio Signals (especially singing & the human voice)
- Crafting the context for high performing *research* teams / organizations.
- Agile / Agility / Scrum / etc.
- Facilitating experiences that connect each other as whole humans.

If you'd like to connect or chat about any of these, please reach out!
