I am a Staff Research Engineer at Antares Audio Technologies, a musician, hobbyist baker, and coffee enthusiast.

I'm interested in:

- Deep Learning on Audio Signals (especially singing & the human voice)
- How to craft the context for high performing *research* teams / organizations.
- Facilitating experiences that connect each other as whole humans.
